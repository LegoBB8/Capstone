## Versions
- Unity 2018.3.0
- SteamVR v2.0.1

## Description
For my Capstone Project, I will be building a VR experience in which workaholic employees turn crazy and try to get the player in various ways. The player would have to find the stress-reliever pill before it’s too late.

## Emotion
Suspense. This project demonstrates, in an unpredictable and mysterious way, the negative impact of stress (mainly in working environments), showing it can cause disorders in employees both mentally and physically.

## How to beat each level (Spoilers ahead!) 
Level 1: There’s a pill behind the monitor. When you grab the pill, a UI will instruct you to throw the pill to the floor. If you do so, the employee will then return normal and you can advance to the next level.

Level 2: There’s a pill on the grey box behind the green door. The door is supposed to trick you into thinking that you cannot teleport through the door. After you throw the pill to the ground, the employee will return normal and you can advance to the final level.

Level 3: There’s a pill hidden inside of the plant in the room behind the green door (a.k.a. the yellow room). To access the room, first you’ll have to wait for a couple of seconds, until you hear a loud bang the SECOND time after the cut-scene, when the green door disappears. Then and only then can you grab the pill amidst of the plant, throw it to the floor, and advance to the end screen.
