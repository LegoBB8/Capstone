Description:
For my Capstone Project, I will be building a VR experience in which workaholic employees turn crazy and try to get the player in various ways. The player would have to find the stress-reliever pill before it’s too late.

Emotion:
Suspense. This project demonstrates, in an unpredictable and mysterious way, the negative impact of stress (mainly in working environments), showing it can cause disorders in employees both mentally and physically.

Achievements: 
~Fundamentals
1.	Scale (100) – I believe that the office environment is quite realistically scaled.
2.	Animation (100) – The characters are animated (using Mixamo animation) both in the background and in the gameplay (i.e. cut-scenes, walking, hurting and disappearing).
3.	Lighting (100) – I used both baked and real-time lighting in this project.
4.	Locomotion (100) – The player can teleport in the main levels by clicking on the touchpad and aiming at the desired location.
5.	Physics (100) – Gravity can be demonstrated when the player drops the pill to the ground.
6.	Video Player (100*2) – Video can be seen, though rather vaguely, on the computer screens.
7.	Empathy (100) – Empathy towards workaholic employees…?

~Completeness
8.	Alternative Storyline (250) – If the player fails one of the levels, he/she’ll have to restart again. But if the player succeeds all the levels, the game will be won. 
9.	AI (250) – I used Navigation to make the (enemy) follow the player.

~Challenges
10.	User-Test (250*2) – Refer to the section below.

User-Test:
Q: Is there any glitches or bugs in the game?
Q: Are you able to see the texts clearly?
Q: Did you experience nausea while playing in this game?
Q: Are the cut-scenes misleading?
Q: Do you feel like you’re in the right scale?
Q: What do you think about the overall gameplay?
Q: Do you feel suspenseful while playing this game?
Q: Can this game make a change to the world? (optional)

- Friend: Said everything is fine, very creative but needs little bit of rework on the cut-scenes.

How to beat each level (in case you get lost) [Spoilers ahead] :
Level 1: There’s a pill behind the monitor. When you grab the pill, a UI will instruct you to throw the pill to the floor. If you do so, the employee will then return normal and you can advance to the next level.

Level 2: There’s a pill on the grey box behind the green door. The door is supposed to trick you into thinking that you cannot teleport through the door. After you throw the pill to the ground, the employee will return normal and you can advance to the final level.

Level 3: There’s a pill hidden inside of the plant in the room behind the green door (a.k.a. the yellow room). To access the room, first you’ll have to wait for a couple of seconds, until you hear a loud bang the SECOND time after the cut-scene, when the green door disappears. Then and only then can you grab the pill amidst of the plant, throw it to the floor, and advance to the end screen.
